# CTF4E: Capture the Flag competitions for education

CTF4E is a framework for practical courses, with focus on combining learning goals with gamification. It has been designed in the context of the [IT security courses at the University of LÃ¼beck](https://www.its.uni-luebeck.de/en/), and is still being actively developed.

Features:
- A pratical course is represented by a number of _labs_, which each consist of a set of _exercises_ and _flags_
- Mandatory and optional exercises per course
- Solving an exercise grants points; wrong submissions may impose penalty points
- Flags are special strings, designed to be hidden and/or hard to acquire; flag points scale with the amount of finds
- Division of students into groups, which share points and, if desired, grades
- Fine-granular control over working times, exercise and flag points
- Scoreboard with rankings per lab and for the entire course
- API for connecting specific _lab servers_

## Ctf4e.Server
[![Docker Image Version (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ctf4e/ctf4e-server?label=docker&sort=date)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ctf4e/ctf4e-server/tags)

This is the main application, which keeps track of exercise results, flag submissions and the scoreboard. It links to the corresponding lab servers.

### Quick start

A new instance of the CTF server can be created by following these steps:
1. Pull the files from the `run/server/` folder.
2. Edit `config.json` and `.env` to match the corresponding runtime environment.
3. `docker-compose up` will start the CTF server.

Finally, open a browser and navigate to the specified host/port.

## Ctf4e.LabServer
[![Docker Image Version (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ctf4e/ctf4e-labserver?label=docker&sort=date)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ctf4e/ctf4e-labserver/tags)

This is a generic lab server implementation, suitable for most common tasks.

Features:
- Integrates with the CTF server
- Keeps track of lab exercises
- Each exercise is either connected to a corresponding exercise entry on the CTF server, or produces a flag code
- Each exercise has a title, a description (optional) and a link (optional)
- List of possible solution strings for each exercise, in key/value format
- Exercises may either require a specific solution (fixed, random key for each user) or an arbitrary one

### Quick start
